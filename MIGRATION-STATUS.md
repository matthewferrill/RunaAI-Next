# RunaAI migration status

Status date: 2026-08-20. This is the living migration handoff for RunaAI-Next. Update it in the same
commit whenever a gate changes repository direction, authority, implementation status, safety
boundaries, verification state, or the next planned work.

## Repository identity and authority

| Repository or branch | Current role | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy `RunaAI` repository | Running implementation and behavior reference | Production, protected data, current behavior, and current operational status until cutover |
| `Runalab` repository | Completed stack-selection and evidence archive | Historical component evidence only; no new product implementation |
| RunaAI-Next `main` | Exact inherited RunaLab completion baseline | Stable integration target only after reviewed migration completion |
| RunaAI-Next `runa2/integration` | Accumulated accepted migration gates | Development integration; not production |
| Short-lived `runa2/*` gate branches | One approved, measured migration slice | Experimental until validated and approved |

The product name is RunaAI. `RunaAI-Next`, `runa2`, and similar labels are repository and branch
identifiers during migration, not product identities.

## Verified lineage

```text
RunaLab source commit: ec5e3466f6f937c8c610bdecf62a09c2491c7137
RunaAI legacy reference at bootstrap: 71ce985e4272895bbd4c3cf38ed8fbcb6090c2a2
RunaAI-Next baseline tag: runalab-stack-baseline-2026-08-20
RunaAI-Next origin: https://github.com/matthewferrill/RunaAI-Next.git
```

`runalab` and `runaai-legacy` are configured as fetch-only remotes in the Omen bootstrap checkout.
Their histories are reference inputs. Never merge the unrelated legacy RunaAI history into this
repository and never push migration work into either source repository.

## Current status

- Repository lineage and source remotes are established.
- GitHub branch protection is active on `main` and `runa2/integration`: pull requests and resolved
  conversations are required; stale reviews are dismissed; admins are included; force-pushes and
  deletion are blocked. Required status checks remain unset until a real CI check exists.
- `main` and `runa2/integration` begin at the exact RunaLab completion commit.
- The completed laboratory evidence, seals, probes, stack bakeoff, model findings, architecture
  assessment, and conditional estimates are inherited.
- Gate 1 now contains an isolated synthetic-only implementation of the smallest ordinary read-only
  chat/research path. It is experimental, unmerged, and not an authority for production behavior.
- No protected RunaAI data has been opened, copied, converted, or migrated.
- No model has been downloaded.
- No persistent service, non-loopback listener, provider credential, production path, or spending has
  been activated. Gate 1 verification used only bounded disposable loopback child processes.
- No migration gate is approved merely by this bootstrap.
- Bootstrap documentation and clean-clone validation were reviewed and merged into
  `runa2/integration` as `94ba860`.
- Gate 0 contract/evidence freeze was approved by the steward on 2026-08-20 for integration through
  PR #2. The steward separately approved Gate 1 implementation on 2026-08-20.
- Gate 1 prerequisites are complete: exact Node 22.22.0 is installed and green, Node 22.23.2 is
  rejected by the sealed latency gate, and the low npm advisory has an explicit synthetic-slice-only
  disposition.
- Gate 1 implementation was explicitly approved and built on `runa2/gate-1-read-only-slice`. The
  deterministic suite passes 21/21 and the disposable real-stack integration passes 22/22 with clean
  shutdown. Qwen3 Coder passes 12/12 live synthetic acceptance runs. On 2026-08-20 the steward approved
  a Gate 1 scope amendment deferring Qwen3.6 deliberate review and the existing live BGE endpoint;
  neither is silently replaced or credited. Gate 1 is green under that amended scope but remains
  unaccepted and unmerged pending review of the regenerated evidence.

## Bootstrap findings

- The inherited Node suite passes **14/14** in the repository-owner context. The sandbox-only first run
  could not create `probes/results/_payloads` in the newly added checkout and reset its localhost stub;
  the exact owner-context rerun passed.
- All **10/10** current seal verifiers pass in this fresh Windows clone.
- Clean-clone validation found four seal verifiers hashing raw checkout bytes while the repository's
  existing `seal-file.mjs` helper canonicalized Git's LF/CRLF transport difference. The four verifiers
  now use that helper. No sealed preregistration, runner, result, seal hash, or adjudication changed.
- `npm ci --cache .npm-cache` installed the committed lockfile: 336 packages, one low-severity audit
  advisory, and an engine warning because installed `posthog-node@5.49.1` requests Node `^20.20.0` or
  `>=22.22.0` while Omen currently provides Node `22.21.0`. Do not run `npm audit fix` or change the
  runtime implicitly. Gate 0 must select a supported Node patch and explicitly disposition the advisory.

## Selected foundation

- Mastra plus AI SDK/OpenAI-compatible application/provider boundary;
- LangGraph JS with PostgreSQL checkpointing;
- PostgreSQL as authoritative records, idempotency, outbox, and postcondition store;
- Nomic embeddings, Qdrant derived vectors, and existing BGE with explicit overlapping windows;
- Caddy as outer transport and timeout boundary;
- OpenTelemetry with allowlisted/redacted attributes;
- deterministic application routing across the selected model roster; and
- Keycloak, OpenFGA, and one-time capabilities only after functional/data parity.

This list selects infrastructure. It does not replace Runa's identity, constitution, authority,
consent-first learning, typed knowledge, project/participant scope, provenance, honest uncertainty,
plain-language steward experience, or governed action pathway.

## Bootstrap validation

Before closing bootstrap:

1. Confirm `main`, `runa2/integration`, and the baseline tag resolve to `ec5e346` before documentation.
2. Confirm `runalab/main` resolves to `ec5e346` and `runaai-legacy/main` resolves to `71ce985`.
3. Confirm source remotes have disabled push URLs.
4. Run the inherited 14 Node tests and all 10 current seal verifiers. **Complete: 14/14 and 10/10.**
5. Run `git diff --check` for the bootstrap documentation. **Complete before staging.**
6. Stage explicit paths, commit on `runa2/bootstrap`, and push only to RunaAI-Next origin.
7. Review the bootstrap branch before merging it into `runa2/integration`.

## Gate 0 evidence

`gate0/` freezes the proposed Gate 1 request/response contract, 18-case synthetic parity corpus,
seven exact deterministic sample outputs, legacy source/test hashes, 12-suite focused profile,
data-inventory command contract, trace allowlist, 24-hour synthetic retention, and hard green
thresholds. The Gate 0 verifier passes 14/14 inherited Node tests, 10/10 seal verifiers, and 12/12
focused legacy suites in the repository-owner context.

The full legacy portable verifier ran 128 applicable checks: 127 passed and one action-executor test
failed because the sandbox identity cannot read `C:\Users\matth\.config\git\ignore`; Git's warning
text entered an assertion that expected an empty change list. Owner DPAPI and configured-provider checks
were correctly skipped, and live approved-library provenance was explicitly not checked because no
application service was started. This is recorded as an environment limitation, not as guarded-lane
or Gate 1 parity evidence.

The Gate 1 prerequisite batch installed exact Node 22.22.0 and reran the full Gate 0 verifier green.
Node 22.23.2 was tested and rejected because its sealed stub average repeatedly measured 12.54–14.70
ms; installed Node 22.22.0 measured 0.66–0.78 ms. The repository now pins the accepted patch.

The npm result is two low dependency entries for one underlying uncontrolled-resource-consumption
advisory, `GHSA-866g-f22w-33x8` / `CVE-2026-8769`, through
`@mastra/core@1.59.0 -> @ai-sdk/provider-utils-v5@3.0.30`. GitHub lists no first patched version and
the newest published 3.x observed during disposition was 3.0.32, within the advertised affected range.
The risk is temporarily accepted only for Gate 1's disposable synthetic boundary with hard time,
byte, abort, and retry controls. It continues to block production and widened network/provider scope.
No dependency was changed during the prerequisite disposition. Full evidence is in
`gate0/GATE1-PREREQUISITES-2026-08-20.md`.

## Next decision

Review the regenerated Gate 1 evidence and decide whether to accept the amended minimum slice. Scope
acceptance is not merge approval and does not start Gate 2. Qwen3.6 deliberate review and the existing
live BGE endpoint remain deferred until a separately approved contract and fresh evidence exist.

No acceptance authorizes protected data, persistent services, production routing, provider
reconfiguration, or a merge. After Gate 1 evidence is explicitly accepted, normal review and branch
protection still apply before integration.
